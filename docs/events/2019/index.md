3. **Pre-race announcements** will begin shortly before 9:00 a.m.  The Fun Run will begin at 9:00 a.m.  We are currently evaluating the route for the Fun Run and will post it here once it is finalized. The 5K and 10K will start together at 9:15 a.m. just South of the intersection of Duck Street and Mathews. The participants will head North on Duck to start. We ask that runners line up along Duck Street according to their pace. We will also have pacers running the race. Watch for them holding signs and wearing specialty t-shirts. Please follow instructions on race day to insure a smooth start. The awards ceremony will take place at approximately 10:30 a.m.


    Parking on the campus of Oklahoma State University is open on the weekend.  Please note that you can never unlawfully park in a handicapped space, or in a restricted area (such as fire zone, or a space marked as 24-hour reserved). Also, understand that immediately prior to, during, and immediately after the race, members of the OSU and City of Stillwater Police Departments will be restricting access to some roads and parking lots. These will be open as quickly as possible, but just be aware.
    The parking lot immediately South of Boone Pickens stadium (LOT #6) is quite congested with participants, emergency vehicles and operations, media and supporters.  Participants and volunteers should expect this parking lot to be CLOSED.  Access to this parking lot will be severely restricted and scarce prior to the race.  If you park in this area, it is VERY LIKELY that you will not be able to exit the lot until Noon.

4. **We are pleased to report that the courses for all races are exactly the same as last year**. 2019 maps for each course are below:

5. **T-Shirts** – As a participant, registrants will **receive a t-shirt, commemorative medallion and other items of interest**. The 2019 T-Shirt design will be posted on the website and social media when it has been completed. T-Shirt sizes requested during the registration process are NOT guaranteed. We do the best we can when placing our order in February and unfortunately, we have run out of some sizes in the past. Please plan accordingly and get there early!

6. **Weather** – we will run the race even if it is raining. If there is lightning in the area, we will work with the Emergency Operations Center and will postpone the race until it is safe to proceed.
