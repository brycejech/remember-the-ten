    <p>
        The "Remember the Ten Run" organizers welcome help from all volunteers. We have a number of different areas where you can help out prior to the race – race packets, check-in, race course stations, etc. And, after the race, there's the awards ceremony, publicity, etc.

    <p>
        When you register to run, you're contributing to supporting OSU Counseling Services. OSU Counseling Services assisted the families of the ten following the crash and, today, they counsel students who experience a loss, concern, or crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also contribute to supporting the race event itself – The Remember the Ten Program Fund OR the Remember the Ten Run Memorial Scholarship. Thank you!
