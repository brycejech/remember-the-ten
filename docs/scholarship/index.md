<img class="u-fl-l" style="margin-right:20px;margin-bottom:10px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/10-ribbon.jpg"> In 2012, the Remember the Ten Run Steering Committee announced the creation of the Remember The Ten Run Scholarship Program! This scholarship program is supporting OSU Masters and Doctoral students enrolled in one of the following degree specialties: Clinical Psychology, Counseling Psychology, Community Counseling, and Marriage and Family Therapy. Recipients receive a $1,000 cash scholarship with $500 being awarded in the Fall and Spring semesters.

The **Remember The Ten Run** is now an annual tradition held on the third Saturday in April. The primary benefactor of the run has been OSU Counseling Services. The run has provided $20,000 per year for the past eleven years to support their endeavors in the areas of grief counseling. The 11th contribution was made on January 20, 2018, at the OSU Men's Basketball Game.

Inspired by the Pickens Legacy Scholarship Matching (PLSM) Program, the run’s steering committee seized the opportunity to fulfill an additional goal they have desired since the run’s inception – the creation of the scholarship. Thanks to the unwavering support of the OSU Foundation, the **Remember the Ten Scholarship Program** was created. It is currently enrolled in the PLSM Program and will quality for 1.5 to 1 match.

Once fully funded at $250,000, the steering committee hopes to award ten $1,000 scholarships each academic year. OSU Counseling Services will continue to be supported every year.
