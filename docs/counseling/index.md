title: RT10 Run Benefits OSU Counseling

---

The registration fees, contributions and sponsorships of "Remember the Ten" Run support both the coordination and expenses of the annual run and also the work of OSU Counseling Services. Kerry Don Alexander was inspired by Bill Hancock's book, "Riding with the Blue Moth" and, in 2000, began to plan a memorial run to celebrate the lives of the "10." Bill Hancock is the father of Will Hancock â€“ one of the 10 who perished in the crash. His book was written as a journal of a bicycle journey across America that helped him work through his grief. The "blue moth" represented the grief and depression that "flew" with Bill after Will's death. Kerry could relate to Bill's grief due to the death of his own father when he was a student at OSU.

In planning the "Remember the Ten" Run, Kerry wanted proceeds from the event to benefit OSU's Counseling Services who, in turn, assist many students, faculty and staff as they deal with grief and depression.

In the past ten years of the "Remember the Ten" Run, over $200,000 has been provided to OSU Counseling Services.

A new outcome of the "Remember the Ten" Run support is the establishment of a Scholarship Program for OSU Masters and Doctoral students pursuing studies in counseling, psychology and family therapies. Read more about it here.
