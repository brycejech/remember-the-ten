On behalf of the entire Remember the Ten Run Steering Committee, our volunteers, supporters and participants, we are deeply saddened by the tragic death of Coach Kurt Budke, Coach Miranda Serna, Olin Branstetter and Paula Branstetter. Coaches Budke and Serna represented Oklahoma State University with class, humility and dignity. Each year the Remember the Ten Run provides support to University Counseling Services. This support helps enable them to provide grief counseling and materials to those on the OSU campus in need. We are humbled to know that those resources are being put to good use. We ask for your prayers and support for the counselors, their staff, and others who are providing support to the families.

Respectfully, Kerry Alexander, Becky Shipley, Jason Pogue
