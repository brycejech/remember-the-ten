                <h3>I'm Free</h3>
                <p>
                    Don't grieve for me, for now I'm free; I'm following the path God laid for me. I took His hand when I heard Him call; I turned my back and left it all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I could not stay another day, to laugh, to love, to work or play. Tasks left undone must stay that way; I found that peace at the close of the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If my parting has left a void, then fill it with remembered joy. A friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss, oh yes, these things I too, will miss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be not burdened with times of sorrow; I wish you the sunshine of tomorrow. My life's been full, I've savored much; good friends, good times, a loved one's touch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps my time seemed all too brief; don't lengthen it now with undue grief. Lift up your heart and share with me; God wanted me now, He set me free.
                </p>
